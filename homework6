Inspection vs. preventive actions

Inspection coupled with causal analysis

Together drive preventive actions

Key difference: error vs fault focus

Inspection vs. formal verification

FV ~= formalized inspection

Focus: people vs. mathematical/logical

Applicability to design/code only?

Existence of formal specifications?

Tradeoff: formality vs. cost

Training and acceptability issues

Inspection vs. testing

Existence of the implemented product

Levels of quality/defects

Static vs. dynamic defects

Localized vs. interconnected defects

Combined approaches

phases and transitions

inspection of testing entities/processes

Inspection vs. fault tolerance

Complementary instead of competing (e.g., inspect individual versions)

Static vs. dynamic

Inspection of FT techniques/mechanisms

Applicability

Testing is applicable for code.

Defect prevention is applicable for known causes.

Inspection is applicable for s/w artifacts.

Formal verificaion is applicable for formal specificaition.

Fault tolerance is applicable for duplication.

Failure containment is applicable for known hazards.

Effectiveness

Testing is effective in occasinal failures.

Defect prevention is effective in systematic problems.

Inspection is effective in scattered faults.

Formal verification is effective in fault absence.

Fault tolerance and failure containment is effective in rare failures and accidents.

Cost

Testing : medium

Defect prevention: low

Inspection: low - medium

Formal verification: high

Fault tolerance: high

failure containment: highest
