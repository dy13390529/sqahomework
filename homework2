Quality becomes a critical attribute of a software product since its absence results in dissatisfied users, loss of money,
and – in the most critical situation – in lost lives. Increasing recognition of the importance of software quality makes
the software engineering “center of gravity” shift from creating a technology solution toward a quality solution.
Development organizations confronted with such an approach are, in general, not prepared to deal with it since their
engineers too often are not adequately educated. And if such knowledge exists, it is still more of an empirical nature
than resulting from a formal educational process. This reality makes the role played by Software Quality Engineering (SQE)
education to change from bad things to a full member of Software Engineering Education family.
